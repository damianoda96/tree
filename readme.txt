Deven Damiano - Project 1 - Machine Learning.

This project has 5 input options.

IMPORTANT: There must be a column labeled "target" in the data, with value either 1 or 0, for the program to work properly.
IMPORTANT: Please run through the options in chronological order, from 1 - 4

-Option 1:
User can enter an entire .csv file that is already complete, where The program will allow the users to enter which labels they would like to train, or they can enter .csv files separately, and the program will concatenate them into a single one to build the tree from. IMPORTANT - the files must have a .csv extension!

The tree.joblib file must be present in the same directory as main.py to work properly.

-Option 2:

Input the .csv file for testing data, AGAIN, this MUST be a .csv file and must contain the same label headings as the training list. It will output accuracy and the confusion matrix.

-Option 3:

The user will be able to enter as many rows of test cases as desired, then a new .csv file will be exported to be tested with in option 4.

-Option 4:

The user will be asked to enter the filename of the tree, which will be tree.joblib, and then the tree will test on the data input by the user in option 3
